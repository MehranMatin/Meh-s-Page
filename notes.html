        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>the browser's <strong>event object will have a target property that tells us exactly which HTML element was interacted with</strong></li>
            <li>If you forget which properties each api object has, you can check the Preview panel in the DevTools Network tab, load the requested URL in another browser tab, or console.log() the response data.</li>
            <li>When <strong>using fetch() to create a request, the request might go one of two ways:</strong><br>The request may find its destination URL and attempt to get the data in question, which would get returned into the .then() method;<br>if the request fails, that error will be sent to the .catch() method.</li>
            <li><strong>Check if request was successful by using the ok property</strong> that's bundled in the response object from fetch(). When the HTTP request status code is something in the 200s, the ok property will be true.</li>
            <li><strong>event.preventDefault()</strong> stops the browser from performing the default action the event wants it to do. In the case of submitting a form, it prevents the browser from sending the form's input data to a URL, as we'll handle what happens with the form input data ourselves in JavaScript.</li>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous communication with a server is often referred to as AJAX</strong>, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. The XML in this term refers to an old-fashioned way of formatting data. XML has been largely replaced by JSON, but the name has persisted.</li>
            <li>When writing href filepaths, a forward slash "/" will always represent the path to the topmost directory of an application or project. When user clicks the &lt;a&gt; element, they will be taken to the topmost directory.<br>Because there is no file specified, the index.html file will be loaded.</li>
            <li>HTML defines a webpage's structure, CSS defines the design, and JavaScript defines the behavior.</li>
            <li>Separation of concerns,: It's better to keep code that serves different purposes in separate files so that it's easier to maintain.</li>
            <li>hero image refers to a large banner image placed prominently at the top of the page. The placement has a specific task: to pique the visitor's curiosity enough to get them reading, scrolling, clicking, and engaging with the website. Think of the hero section as the banner, headline, or billboard for a website.</li>
            <li>Creating the skeleton of an HTML document is also known as "scaffolding".</li>
            <li>Because the &lt;title&gt; element's content appears in the browser's tab, it's good practice to structure the content as [page title] - [site title]. Page titles should be descriptive but also concise because Google cuts off search result titles at around 60 characters.</li>
            <li>A set of HTML code that builds out a part of the overall page's UI is commonly referred to as a "component". The idea behind a component is that it can be reused in multiple places throughout a site.</li>
            <li>Right-click the page and select "View page source" to see its HTML.</li>
