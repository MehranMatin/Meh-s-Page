        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check if request was successful by using the ok property</strong> that's bundled in the response object from fetch(). When the HTTP request status code is something in the 200s, the ok property will be true.</li>
            <li><strong>event.preventDefault()</strong> stops the browser from performing the default action the event wants it to do. In the case of submitting a form, it prevents the browser from sending the form's input data to a URL, as we'll handle what happens with the form input data ourselves in JavaScript.</li>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous communication with a server is often referred to as AJAX</strong>, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. The XML in this term refers to an old-fashioned way of formatting data. XML has been largely replaced by JSON, but the name has persisted.</li>
            <li>When writing href filepaths, a forward slash "/" will always represent the path to the topmost directory of an application or project. When user clicks the &lt;a&gt; element, they will be taken to the topmost directory.<br>Because there is no file specified, the index.html file will be loaded.</li>
            <li>HTML defines a webpage's structure, CSS defines the design, and JavaScript defines the behavior.</li>
            <li>Separation of concerns,: It's better to keep code that serves different purposes in separate files so that it's easier to maintain.</li>
            <li>hero image refers to a large banner image placed prominently at the top of the page. The placement has a specific task: to pique the visitor's curiosity enough to get them reading, scrolling, clicking, and engaging with the website. Think of the hero section as the banner, headline, or billboard for a website.</li>
            <li>Creating the skeleton of an HTML document is also known as "scaffolding".</li>
            <li>Because the &lt;title&gt; element's content appears in the browser's tab, it's good practice to structure the content as [page title] - [site title]. Page titles should be descriptive but also concise because Google cuts off search result titles at around 60 characters.</li>
            <li>A set of HTML code that builds out a part of the overall page's UI is commonly referred to as a "component". The idea behind a component is that it can be reused in multiple places throughout a site.</li>
            <li>Right-click the page and select "View page source" to see its HTML.</li>
